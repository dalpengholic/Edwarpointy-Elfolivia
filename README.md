Decision Point-1: Which langauge would be better to implement simple echo server?
- Candidates: Golang, Python
- After a bit of searching for each language, I ended up choosing Golang.
- Compared to Python, with Golang it seemed easier to implement an Echo server through the default libraries without any web framework. Also, the number of lines of code required to write seemed short.
