Main consideration during the whole assginment
```
- Provide simple and to-the-point solutions to the tasks.
- Choose the tooling which you consider minimal for the given assignment.
- Make sure to include instructions about how to reproduce your solution.
- Your MVP will not go straight into production. However, your programmer peers will look at it, and it will be hard to convince them if the code is messy.
